      <p>A fourth-minute own goal by Senegal's Saliou Ciss was enough to give Egypt a 1-0 win in the first leg of their World Cup play-off in Cairo.<br><br>

        Ciss was incredibly unlucky when a shot from Mohamed Salah was pushed on to the bar by Edouard Mendy before striking the defender and going into the net.<br><br>
        
        The game was billed as a rerun of the recent Africa Cup of Nations final - won by Senegal on penalties after the match ended 0-0 - and to an extent it captured the cagey nature of that occasion back in February, with few chances of significance created by either side.<br><br>
        
        The game featured Liverpool's two star strikers Salah and Sadio Mane, but neither of them had stellar games.<br><br>
        Nevertheless, on a day dominated by north African teams - Algeria and Tunisia also won 1-0, albeit away, and Morocco got an away goal in a draw in DR Congo - Ciss' unfortunate moment meant Egypt matched the achievements of their continental neighbours.<br><br>

        The teams meet again in the second leg on Tuesday, with the winner qualifying for November's tournament in Qatar.<br><br>
        In this repeat of the African Cup of Nations final, Egypt beat Senegal by the narrowest of margins to take the lead in the first leg of the qualifiers for Qatar.<br><br>
        Both sides had a number of attempts, but the size of the occasion meant a lot were half-chances and deflected efforts.<br><br>

        It made for a nervy last few minutes, but the Pharaohs held out.<br><br>

        They will now be out for revenge in the second leg after the heartbreaking penalty defeat last month, which stopped them from adding a record eighth Afcon title.<br><br>

        But Senegal coach Aliou Cisse may be cheered by knowing that his team surely won't play as badly in front of their home fans - and they're only down by a single goal.<br><br>
