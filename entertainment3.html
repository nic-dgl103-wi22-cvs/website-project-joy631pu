      <p>Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins had opioids, marijuana and other drugs in his system before he died, Colombian investigators say.<br><br>

        A toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including anti-depressants.<br><br>
        
        The cause of death remains unknown and investigators did not say if the mix of drugs was a factor.<br><br>
        
        Hawkins, 50, died at a hotel in Bogota, with the band due to play at a music festival this weekend.<br><br>
        
        Local officials said an ambulance was sent to the hotel after a man reported having chest pains.<br><br>
        
        He did not respond to resuscitation efforts and was declared dead, the city's health department said.<br><br>
        
        The Colombian attorney general's office said it was still investigating and would release more details later.<br><br>
        
        "The National Institute of Forensic Medicine continues to conduct the necessary medical studies to ascertain the cause of death," it added.<br><br>
        
        Fans of the band who were in the Colombian capital to see them play have laid flowers outside the hotel.<br><br>
        Hawkins' death was announced by Foo Fighters in a statement, in which they said they were "devastated" by the loss and pleaded for his family to be given privacy.<br><br>

        He joined the band in 1997 and on top of his drumming skills had writing credits on several songs and sometimes sang at concerts.<br><br>

       Foo Fighters have cancelled their remaining South American dates.<br><br>

       News of Hawkins' death has stunned fans, with thousands lighting candles and holding a minute's silence outside the venue where they were due to play.<br><br>

      Tributes have been paid from the world of rock and beyond.<br><br>

      Ozzy Osbourne said Hawkins was "an amazing musician", while Mick Jagger called the news "incredibly sad".<br><br>
