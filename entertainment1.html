      <p>Sir Kenneth Branagh is out of Covid isolation and will attend Sunday night's 94th Academy Awards.<br><br>

        Ciarán Hinds, who is nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, will also go to the ceremony.<br><br>
        
        There had been concerns that they would be unable to attend after both testing positive for Covid earlier in March.<br><br>
        
        Belfast has seven Oscar nominations in total, including two for Branagh in the Best Director and Best Original Screenplay categories.<br><br>
        
        Those nominations mean he has become the first person to be shortlisted in seven different categories throughout his career.<br><br>
        Dame Judi Dench is nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Sir Van Morrison's Down to Joy is up for Best Song.<br><br>

        The film is also nominated for Best Sound and the biggest prize of the night, Best Picture.<br><br>

       Another contender for Best Picture, the western film The Power of the Dog, has 12 nominations in total, while Apple TV's Coda is another strong contender for the prestigious award.<br><br>

      After three years without a host, a trio of female comic actors - Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes - will take the reins at the ceremony this year.<br><br>
