       <h2>Ontario Liberal Party promises 10 paid sick days, higher minimum wage</h2>

      <p>The Ontario Liberal leader Steven Del Duca released a plank of his party’s 2022 election platform during an event in Toronto on Saturday.<br><br>


        The policies, which include promises around the minimum wage and paid sick days, were coined a “plan for economic dignity.”<br><br>
        
        Del Duca unveiled the plan surrounded by supporters and candidates at the party’s first in-person event of 2022.<br><br>
        He pledged to raise the minimum wage in Ontario to $16 per hour by Jan. 1, 2023, if elected premier.<br><br>

        He said the party would “urgently” develop a “living wage structure” that provides pay that corresponds to where Ontarians live in the province.<br><br>
        A regionally-adjusted living wage could be as high as $22 an hour in Toronto, advocates have said.<br><br>

        In January, the conservative Ontario government raised the minimum wage from $14.35 to $15 per hour, and from $12.55 per hour to $15 for liquor servers.<br><br>
        
        The NDP has also promised a $16 minimum wage as of Oct. 1, with plans to raise it to $20 an hour by 2026.<br><br>
        
        “I believe that economic dignity is far too important to be left to luck,” Del Duca told supporters.<br><br>
        The announcement also included the promise of 10 sick days for Ontario workers.

        The Ontario Liberal Party said it would ban employers from requiring a doctor’s note and reimburse up to $200 per day to businesses for workers who are off sick.<br><br>
        
        The party said the policy would cost approximately $800 million.</p>
